# Mean Water Level Project

This repository provides the code for testing theoretical arguments based on the seminal work of [Longuet-Higgins (1986)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112086001325) and more recent advancements made by A. Blaser that link the mean wave level to the surface gravity wave field.
