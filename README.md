# Mean Water Level Project : Linking the mean water level and surface waves.  
**Authors**: Aidan Blaser and Luke Colosi.\

This repository is provides the code for testing theoretical arguments based on the seminal work of [Longuet-Higgins (1986)]() and more recent advancements made by A. Blaser that link the mean wave level to the surface gravity wave field.
